## T-SQL HW03

**1. In general, why would you even want to join two (or more) tables together? This is a good time to
think about the nature of relational algebra.**

* Normalized tables are hard to read, by joining tables it will make it easier to get data that relates to another

**2. Describe in your own words the output from an *inner join*.**

* Returns records that have matching values

**3. Describe in your own words the output from an *outer join*.**

 * Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table, can return a large amount of results

**4. Describe in your own words the output from an *cross join*.**

* Creates paired combinations of the rows of the tables that will be joined

**5. A convenient mnemonic for remembering the various joins is "Ohio." Why is this true?**

* Inner join - O
* Left and right outer join - hi
* Full outer join - O

**6. Give an example of a *composite join*.**

* Matches multiple attributes from each side

**7. What is the difference between the following two queries? The business problem is "How many orders
do we have from each customer?"**

* ================first query===============
* 1 SELECT C.custid, COUNT(*) AS numorders
* 2 FROM Sales.Customers AS C
* 3 LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.Orders AS O
* 4 ON C.custid = O.custid
* 5 GROUP BY C.custid;
* 1 ================second query===============
* 2 SELECT C.custid, COUNT(O.orderid) AS numorders
* 4 FROM Sales.Customers AS C
* 5 LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.Orders AS O
* 6 ON C.custid = O.custid
* 7 GROUP BY C.custid;
* The first query uses the count aggregate function, counts all rows regardless of customers who have placed orders
* The second query uses the count column function, counts non-Nulls only, customers who have placed an order


**8. What might be one reason the following query does not return the column *custID* in this query?**

* 1 SELECT C.custid, C.companyname, O.orderid, O.orderdate
* 2 FROM Sales.Customers AS C
* 3 LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.Orders AS O
* 4 ON C.custid = O.custid
* 5 WHERE O.orderdate >= '20160101';
* It is being discarded because of the WHERE statement, the predicate in the WHERE clause is final, where is the one in the join clause is not
